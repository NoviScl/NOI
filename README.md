# NOI Training Materials

This repo contains some tutorials I wrote for my school's NOI training. It is mainly meant for beginners. I am working on materials for some advanced topics as well. Feel free to contact me if you find a mistake or want to collaborate.

I am following some chapters from [this book](http://www.ituring.com.cn/book/1044). I recommend [this repo](https://github.com/yogykwan/acm-challenge-workbook/tree/master/src) which contains solutions of the practice questions from the book.
